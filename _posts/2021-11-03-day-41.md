### 📚 Reading Github Issues
Nothing exciting.

### ⚙️  ipnet

I finished up writing the examples for the net/ipnet package. I wasn't able to
get pksite running locally and pointing at my local go to double check it
though. I asked on gopher slack, but no reply.

Maybe one day I'll figure out how and update the docs 😅.

### 📌 Other Updates

I bumped a bunch of submissions that were just languishing. Hopefully I will get
some more merged before the end of my time here. There aren't that many days
left, especially considered my upcoming vacations!
