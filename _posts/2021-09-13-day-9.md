### üìö Reading Github Issues
Started today by reading the 25 new issues.
* There was an [emoji related bug](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48356)!
* Two http2 bugs submitted by the same person:
  [1](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48340),
  [2](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48341). The reporter submitted fixes
  for both.
* üëÄ [A bug about matching preferred against supported
  languages](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48324) caught my eye.


### üá≥üá¥ üá©üá∞Matching Preferred Against Supported Languages

> Consider an application, such as a web site, with support for multiple
> languages in its user interface. When a user arrives with a list of preferred
> languages, the application must decide which language it should use in its
> presentation to the user. This requires finding the best match between the
> languages the application supports and those the user prefers. This post

> \- ["Language and Locale Matching in Go Blog Post"](https://go.dev/blog/matchlang)

From reading the [x/text/language pkg
docs](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/text/language#ParseAcceptLanguage) I
learned that each language has a tag and _can_ have a local.

For example
* `en`: English
* `en-US`: American English
* `en-GB`: British English
* `az`: Azerbaijani
* `az-Latn`: Azerbaijani written in Latin script
* `az-Arab`: Azerbaijani written in Arabic script

The matcher has a bunch of complicated information based on each language and the
script it is written in. You can compare two languages and see how close they
are:

| Language A | Language B | Confidence in Match |
| --- | --- | --- |
| French | French | Exact |
| French | Canadian French | High |
| Simplified Chinese | Traditional Chinese | Low |
| Simplified Chinese | English | No |



So the server has list of supported languages, a user reports which
languages they speak, and then the matcher will give the best match:
```
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"golang.org/x/text/language"
)

func main() {

	supportedLanguages := []language.Tag{
		language.English,
		language.BritishEnglish,
		language.French,
		language.Afrikaans,
		language.BrazilianPortuguese,
		language.EuropeanPortuguese,
		language.SimplifiedChinese,
	}

	languagesUserSpeaks := []language.Tag{
		language.Danish,
		language.MustParse("en-au"),
	}

	m := language.NewMatcher(supportedLanguages)

	lang, _, conf := m.Match(languagesUserSpeaks...)

	fmt.Printf("Chose %v with %v confidence", lang, conf)
}

// This outputs: Chose en-GB-u-rg-auzzzz with High confidence
```

But wtf is `en-GB-u-rg-auzzzz`?!

The comments in golang were very unhelpful. I finally found this [unicode
document](https://unicode.org/reports/tr35/) that explains that the prefix
`-u-rg-` and the suffix `zzzz` indicate a region override. This means that the
language `en-GB` was chosen (because it knows that British English is the
closest to Australian English). Then `au` is the region override, which is
basically additional information so a server _could_ alter the information
regarding default currency, default calendar, default measurement system, etc.

During this investigation I also found [this
comment](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24211#issuecomment-813105035)
listing a bunch of unfixed bugs in the language package. Maybe something to come
back to if I ever run out of things to do.

### üêû The bugs

So in researching this language stuff and reproducing the already reported bug I
noticed that the [example for
Matcher](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/text/language#Matcher) was not running
properly. I looked at the [source
code](https://github.com/golang/text/blob/383b2e75a7a4198c42f8f87833eefb772868a56f/language/examples_test.go#L341)
and noticed an odd `TODO` at the bottom.

When I ran the test locally as is, it passed. When I removed the `TODO` it
failed. That `TODO` was put there 4 years ago, back before any region overrides
were added to the matched languages.

üéâüéâ So I submitted my first two issues
1. [x/text/language: ExampleMatcher test is
   broken](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48361). This one I submitted a
   fix for.
2. [testing: false positives for examples with comments at
   end](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48362)

#### üìé How are examples rendered?

I think there is a 3rd issue though. Not only was there a false positive when I
ran `go test`, but ALSO the example website couldn't render the test properly.
It was missing the last `}`.

I _think_ this was related to the `TODO` as well, but I can't prove it, because
I can't change it and rerender the website (or I haven't figured out how to
yet).

I started to look into how the rendering is happening. I found [this `Examples`
function](https://pkg.go.dev/go/doc#Examples) in the docs package that reads
from a test file and then turns all the data into an ast.

Here is my example test file:
```
package main

import "fmt"

func ExampleThisTestShouldNotPass() {
	fmt.Println("meow")
	// Output:
	// bark

	// TODO
}
```

Here is my code that parses it:
```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"go/ast"
	"go/doc"
	"go/parser"
	"go/token"
	"log"
)

func main() {
	fset := token.NewFileSet()
	node, err := parser.ParseFile(fset, "examples_test.go", nil, parser.ParseComments)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	examples := doc.Examples(node)

	first := examples[0]

	fmt.Printf("Name: %v\n Doc: %v\n Code: %v\n Output: %v\n", first.Name, first.Doc, first.Code, first.Output)
	fmt.Printf("Play: %v\n Comments: %v\n\n", first.Play, first.Comments)

	ast.Print(fset, first.Code)
}
```

Here is the output:
```
$ go run main.go
Name: ThisTestShouldNotPass
 Doc:
 Code: &{65 [0xc000010130] 119}
 Output:
Play: <nil>
 Comments: [0xc00000c078 0xc00000c0a8]

     0  *ast.BlockStmt {
     1  .  Lbrace: examples_test.go:5:37
     2  .  List: []ast.Stmt (len = 1) {
     3  .  .  0: *ast.ExprStmt {
     4  .  .  .  X: *ast.CallExpr {
     5  .  .  .  .  Fun: *ast.SelectorExpr {
     6  .  .  .  .  .  X: *ast.Ident {
     7  .  .  .  .  .  .  NamePos: examples_test.go:6:2
     8  .  .  .  .  .  .  Name: "fmt"
     9  .  .  .  .  .  }
    10  .  .  .  .  .  Sel: *ast.Ident {
    11  .  .  .  .  .  .  NamePos: examples_test.go:6:6
    12  .  .  .  .  .  .  Name: "Println"
    13  .  .  .  .  .  }
    14  .  .  .  .  }
    15  .  .  .  .  Lparen: examples_test.go:6:13
    16  .  .  .  .  Args: []ast.Expr (len = 1) {
    17  .  .  .  .  .  0: *ast.BasicLit {
    18  .  .  .  .  .  .  ValuePos: examples_test.go:6:14
    19  .  .  .  .  .  .  Kind: STRING
    20  .  .  .  .  .  .  Value: "\"meow\""
    21  .  .  .  .  .  }
    22  .  .  .  .  }
    23  .  .  .  .  Ellipsis: -
    24  .  .  .  .  Rparen: examples_test.go:6:20
    25  .  .  .  }
    26  .  .  }
    27  .  }
    28  .  Rbrace: examples_test.go:11:1
    29  }

```

From my very untrained eye it _looks_ like it is grabbing that last bracket. So
this doesn't explain why it wasn't rendering correctly on the website.
However it is not grabbing the output properly. Maybe that is the source of the
second issue I opened.

### üßê What about all those TODOs from Friday?

I haven't forgotten them! I swear!
