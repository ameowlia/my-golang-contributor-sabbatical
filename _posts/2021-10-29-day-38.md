### 🥖 💂‍♀️Language Matching

I spent this afternoon continuing to look into [this
x/text/language](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/49176) issue. The issue is
basically:
* The website supports `[English, French]`
* When I say I speak `[British English, French with a German local, Canadian
  French]` in preference order, then it returns "English" as the best language.
* But when I add another _low preference_ language to the end of the list
  `[British English, French with a German local, Canadian French, English with a
  German local]` then it returns "French" as the best language.
* Why does adding another language to the _end_ of my preferences change which
  language is returned.

🐛 Like the issue author, I absolutely thought this was a bug when I first read
it. But after digging into the code for two days I have determined that this is
actually working as intended.

#### **Here are the two assumptions about language matching that I learned:**

1️⃣  **Most people do not speak multiple languages equally.**

The algorithm usually puts a heavy emphasis on the first exact language match
and then "pins" that language. [Docs about assumption
1](https://github.com/golang/text/blob/5bd84dd9b33bd2bdebd8a6a6477920a8e492d47f/language/match.go#L547-L552).
```
m := language.NewMatcher([]language.Tag{language.English, language.French})

desired, _, _ := language.ParseAcceptLanguage("en-GB, fr")
tag, i, conf := m.Match(desired...)
fmt.Println("case A", tag, i, conf) // en-u-rg-gbzzzz
// Returns English because it is the first exact language match, even though
// "fr" is an exact region and language match.
```

2️⃣    **If a person lists the dialects they know and the languages are _not_
continuous, then it is assumed they speak all of those languages equally well
and it will not give extra preference to the first exact language match it
finds.**

For example, if your list of desired language tags are: `en-GB, fr-DE, fr-CA,
en-DE` then I will assume that you speak English and French very well.  In this
case, the algorithm will not "pin" English even though it is first. Instead it
runs the whole algorithm for all of the options and it decides that `fr-DE` is
a better match because of regionality (Germany is closer to France than Great
Britain is to the US). [Docs about assumption
2](https://github.com/golang/text/blob/5bd84dd9b33bd2bdebd8a6a6477920a8e492d47f/language/match.go#L571-L572).

```
desired, _, _ = language.ParseAcceptLanguage("en-GB, fr-DE, en-DE")
tag, i, conf = m.Match(desired...)
fmt.Println("case B", tag, i, conf) // fr-u-rg-dezzzz

// Because of the ordering of dialects, the algorithm assumes this speaker
// knows English and French well. Returns French because Germany is closer to
// France then Great Britain is to the US.
```

🎉 I may not have made a code contribution, but at least I helped!
