### 📚 Reading Github Issues
Oops. Got distracted and didn't read any.

### 💾 Go Memory Model

I watched a (sadly, private) video of a talk given by my mentor [Gareth
Smith](https://www.kindness.city/blog/) about some background knowledge to
understand the changes to the [Go memory model as discussed by Russ Cox
](https://research.swtch.com/gomm). It was great; I learned more about
pipelining, branch prediction, and the happens-before relation. And I am not
just saying that because I know he reads this (helloooo).

The more resources I consume around this topic the more pieces are being filled
in. Which, [like Julia
Evans](https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/09/20/teaching-by-filling-in-knowledge-gaps/),
is my favoite way to learn.

I planned to read the Russ' 3 blog posts on memory models
([1](https://research.swtch.com/hwmm), [2](https://research.swtch.com/plmm),
[3](https://research.swtch.com/gomm)), but I didn't make it there today. Instead
I had much fun playing with assembly.

### ✏️ Reviewing the Assembly I Already Know

Instead of jumping straight back into passing variables, I decided to write a
little function that would use all of the knowledge I already have. So here is
my function that: takes arguments, uses jumps to make a loops, and calls out to
another function.


💻 **countDown** takes an integer and counts down from that integer to zero.
Then it explodes 💥

Assembly:
```
TEXT ·countDown(SB),$0
	MOVQ val+0(FP), BP
	MOVQ $0, AX // AX = 0
	CMPQ AX, BP
	JGE END
LOOP:
	MOVQ BP, 0(SP)
	CALL ·printInt(SB)
	CALL ·waitOneSec(SB)
	SUBQ $1, BP
	MOVQ $0, AX // doesn't work unless you set it back to 0
	CMPQ AX, BP
	JL LOOP
END:
	CALL ·printBoom(SB)
	RET
```

Go:
```
func countDown(val int)

func main(){
	arg, _ := strconv.Atoi(os.Args[1])
  countDown(arg)
}

func printInt(val int) {
	fmt.Println(val)
}

func printBoom() {
	fmt.Println("boom")
}

func waitOneSec() {
	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
}
```

Output:
```
$ ./main 4

4
3
2
1
boom
```
Open question:
* ❓ Why do I have to set AX back to 0 every time in the loop? Maybe I should be
	using a different register?

### 📥 Passing Variables in Assembly

Yesterday I figured out how to pass _one_ variable to another function in
assembly. But I didn't understand what it was doing. Like the good staff software
engineer I am, I just copied some code off stack overflow without understanding
it. Today is the day to understand!

A stranger on the internet recommended that I read the book ["x86-64 Assembly
Language Programming with Ubuntu"](http://www.egr.unlv.edu/~ed/assembly64.pdf).
Despite the dry name, it has been very readable!

In the section about arguments I saw that there are three ways to pass arguments
between functions:
1. Placing values in register
2. Globally defined variables
3. Putting values and/or addresses on stack 👈 this is the one my example did

So I set out to try to do each one.

### 🥞 Passing Variables by Adding Them to the Stack

Yesterday I was able to add a variable to the stack  with this instruction:
`MOVQ BX, 0(SP)`. I _think_ this is adding the variable onto what will become the
next function stack frame. Then the variable is already there waiting for the next
function. Or something?

I got one variable working. Next step: TWO VARIABLES! Why not just do the same
thing twice?

💻 **print2Vals** takes two ints and passes them to a print function. nice.
```
// main.go snippet
print2Vals(val, val+1)


// assembly snippet
TEXT ·print2Vals(SB),$0
	MOVQ a+0(FP), BX
	MOVQ b+0(FP), BP
	MOVQ BX, 0(SP) // pushing it onto the stack
	MOVQ BP, 0(SP) // pushing it onto the stack... again?
	CALL ·print2Ints(SB)
	RET

// output
$ ./print 7
7 17347307
```

Well it didn't _error_, but it also didn't work. Clearly the second var didn't
come through and some random left over garbage was read for the second
variables.

Next guess: add it to the stack but offset by 8 bytes.
```
// assembly snippet
TEXT ·print2Vals(SB),$0
	MOVQ a+0(FP), BX
	MOVQ b+0(FP), BP
	MOVQ BX, 0(SP) // pushing it onto the stack
	MOVQ BP, 8(SP) // pushing it onto the stack?
	CALL ·print2Ints(SB)
	RET

// output
$ ./print 7
7 7

runtime: unexpected return pc for runtime.sigpanic called from 0x7
stack: frame={sp:0xc000092f10, fp:0xc000092f60} stack=[0xc000092000,0xc000093000)
0x000000c000092e10:  0x000000c000092e18  0x000000000102e1a0 <runtime.addOneOpenDeferFrame.func1+0x0000000000000000>
0x000000c000092e20:  0x0000000001043367 <runtime.sigpanic+0x0000000000000327>  0x000000c000092f10
0x000000c000092e30:  0x000000c0000001a0  0x0000000000000000
0x000000c000092e40:  0x000000c000092f00  0x000000000102ef74 <runtime.gopanic+0x0000000000000114>
0x000000c000092e50:  0x00000000011363a0  0x000000000109f560
0x000000c000092e60:  0x000000c00009add0  0x00000
...
```
So it printed 7 twice? And then broke.

So my favorite way to figure something out is to look for examples, so I found
[this example of a function call passing variables in
go](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/17c513e722e72739a59851e3a052952de36315aa/src/runtime/sys_darwin_amd64.s#L26-L35).
In the example it is passing variables via registers, but it is also doing a
push/pop thing. Hmmmm 🧐 Let's copy it!

```
// assembly snippet
TEXT ·print2Vals(SB),$0
	PUSHQ BP
	MOVQ a+0(FP), BX
	MOVQ b+8(FP), AX
	MOVQ BX, 0(SP)
	MOVQ AX, 8(SP)
	CALL ·print2Ints(SB)
	POPQ	BP
	RET

// output
$ ./print 7
7 8
```

It worked!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

I think the push and pop are doing some variable clean up. According to the
[assembly book](http://www.egr.unlv.edu/~ed/assembly64.pdf):
> Additionally, when the function is completed, the calling routine is responsible for
> clearing the arguments from the stack. Instead of doing a series of pop instructions, the
> stack pointer, rsp, is adjusted as necessary to clear the arguments off the stack.

### 🗳 Passing Variables by Register

So earlier I saw the example in
[go](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/17c513e722e72739a59851e3a052952de36315aa/src/runtime/sys_darwin_amd64.s#L26-L35)
that passed variables via registers.

Also I found this passage in the assembly book:
> The standard calling convention specifies the usage of registers when making function
> calls. Specifically, some registers are expected to be preserved across a function call.

How hard could this be?

💻 **print2SixesWithRegisters** (attempts to) pass the integer 6 twice to the
print function.
```
// main.go snippet

func print2SixesWithRegisters()
func main(){ printSixesWithRegisters() }

// assembly snippet
TEXT ·print2SixesWithRegisters(SB),NOSPLIT,$0
	PUSHQ BP
	MOVQ $6, SI      // arg 2?
	MOVQ $6, DI      // arg 1?
	CALL ·print2Ints(SB)
	POPQ	BP
	RET

// output
$ ./print
824634322800 17347295
```

Um. That's not what I intended. It just printed some junk.

I spent _a lot_ of time tryign to debug this. Nothing seemed to work. I tried every register.
Everything I read said that this should work.

But what if this only works for other _assembly_ functions???

So I set up a test with two different functions, where the sender function
passes variables via reigsters to the reciever function. Then the reciever
function calls the print function and passes arguments by placing them on the
stack (since I know that one works).

```
// assembly snippet
TEXT ·sender(SB),NOSPLIT,$0
	MOVQ $6, SI
	MOVQ $6, DX
	CALL ·reciever(SB)
	RET

TEXT ·reciever(SB),NOSPLIT,$0
	PUSHQ BP
	MOVQ	SP, BP
	MOVQ SI, 0(SP)
	MOVQ DX, 8(SP)
	CALL ·print2Ints(SB)
	MOVQ	BP, SP
	POPQ BP
	RET

// output
$ ./print
6 6
panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
[signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x1 addr=0x6 pc=0x6]

goroutine 1 [running]:
main.main()
	/Users/adowns/workspace/amelia/assembly-str/main.go:26 +0x4b
```

And it **kinda** worked! It _did_ print out 6 twice... before getting a seg
fault. I couldn't figure out the seg fault before the end of the day, hopefully
I'll figure it out tomorrow!


### 🔗 And some frontend work!

I added some previous/next links to all of my posts. Thank god for [jekyll
tutorials](https://david.elbe.me/jekyll/2015/06/20/how-to-link-to-next-and-previous-post-with-jekyll.html).
(But I made them pink and added some _wonderful_ `<hr>`s.)
