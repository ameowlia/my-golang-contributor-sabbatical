### 📚 Reading Github Issues
Caught up on the 36 github issues opened in the last two days.
* [One referenced bumping target test times by
  100%](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48805). Relatable.
* [One referenced the go fuzz (no hypen) minimizer and how it takes a long time
  to minimize very long inputs](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48820).
  Apparently the "removing every subset of bytes" part of the minimization can
  take awhile. Could be fun to dig into in the future.

### 📌 Updates on Older Contributions

On Aug 30, I wrote some code to add testable examples for all of the IP functions in the
net package. According to the contribution guide: _"Excluding very trivial
changes, all contributions should be connected to an existing issue."_
I thought testable examples might be classified as trivial, so I submitted my
change and...🦗 🦗 🦗. Today I opened [an
issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48848) and linked the submission to
it in hopes that it will ping the reviewers 👀 .

Last week I submitted a change to improve the go fuzz (no hypen) minimizer. It
wasn't assigned any reviewers. I assumed this was because it was an off week for
the go team. Today I decided to self-assign two people who I have seen in the go
fuzz (no hyphen) area. Turns out it was a mistake with the configuration that it didn't get
a reviewer. Jay left some comments on the code that I hope to look at on Monday.

### 🤩 Assembly Help from an Internet Friend

[Two days ago](http://localhost:4000/2021/10/05/day-22.html) I asked for help in
the #assembly channel in gopher slack and a nice internet stranger helped me.
After doing what he suggested, I still had some open questions that I wrote in
my post. They were...

* ❓ Why did I need to clear the DX register [before I used IDIVQ]? DX is the register where the
remainder is stored. Why couldn't IDIVQ just write over what is already in DX?
* ❓ Why did _not_ clearing the register result in an error `panic: runtime error:
integer divide by zero`? Neither the divisor or dividend were zero so why did I
get _this_ particular error?

Well, my thoughts must be pretty loud, because today MY INTERNET FRIEND ANSWERED
THOSE QUESTIONS EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T ASK HIM:

<img width="90%" src="https://i.ibb.co/KmKywck/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-6-33-20-PM.png">

I thanked him, showed him my blog where I asked those exact questions, and he
came back with even more help. Thank you so much Damian!

### 🗳 Passing Variables by Register

Yesterday I ended stuck on getting my functions to pass arguments via registers
without also getting a invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference error.
Today I tried removing NOSPLIT since I knew it has something to do with stack
frames and it worked!

💻 **sender** puts the integer 6 into two different registers and passes them
to the function reciever.

💻 **reciever** takes the arguments and passes them to a go print function.
```
TEXT ·sender(SB),NOSPLIT,$0
	MOVQ $6, SI
	MOVQ $6, DX
	CALL ·reciever(SB)
	RET

TEXT ·reciever(SB),$0-16 // <--- No more NOSPLIT
	PUSHQ BP
	MOVQ SI, 0(SP)
	MOVQ DX, 8(SP)
	CALL ·print2Ints(SB)
	POPQ BP
	RET

```

🧐 My guess for the reason for the error is that the frame for the routine, plus
anything it called, did _not_ fit into the spare space remaining in the current
stack segment. I'm still not sure _how_ to make it fit though.

### 🌎 Screw Passing Variables. Use Globals!

Globals! The last way to pass variables! Does it really count as a way to _pass_
variables, though?

I struggled way too hard on this. It took me a bit to realize that I needed to
define `DATA` and `GLOBL`. I found examples in
[go](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/1ceb72394e250d5776726bba63c34cd2be5745d1/src/runtime/rt0_android_386.s#L26-L27),
as always, to crib off of.

💻 **printSixWithGlobals** looks at a global variable where the integer 6 is
stored and passes it to a go print function.
```
// DATA	symbol+offset(SB)/width, value
DATA  six+0x00(SB)/8, $6

// NOPTR - This data contains no pointers
// R0DATA - This data is read only
GLOBL six(SB),(NOPTR+RODATA),$8

TEXT ·printSixWithGlobals(SB),NOSPLIT,$0
	PUSHQ BP
	MOVQ six(SB), DX
	MOVQ DX, 0(SP)
	CALL ·printInt(SB)
	POPQ BP
	RET
```


### ➗ Odd Without DIV

My internet friend challenged me to rewrite my odd function, but not use DIV.
Here's what I came up with.

💻 **oddWithNoDiv** takes an integer and prints whether it is "even" or "odd".
```
TEXT ·oddWithNoDiv(SB),NOSPLIT,$0
	MOVQ val+0(FP), BX      // BX = value to check
	MOVQ $0, DX             // DX = always 0
EVEN_LOOP:
	CMPQ DX, BX             // check if the value is 0
	JGE PRINT_EVEN          // if it is 0, then we know it is even
	SUBQ $1, BX             // else, subtract 1 from the value
	JMP ODD_LOOP            // try the odd loop
ODD_LOOP:
	CMPQ DX, BX             // check if the value is 0
	JGE PRINT_ODD           // if it is 0, then we know it is odd
	SUBQ $1, BX             // else, subtract 1 from the value
	JMP EVEN_LOOP           // try the even loop
PRINT_EVEN:
	CALL ·printEven(SB)
	JMP END
PRINT_ODD:
	CALL ·printOdd(SB)
	JMP END
END:
	RET
```

### 🎥 Lecture 4: Assembly Language & Computer Architecture

With the last 30 minutes of my day (besides writing this blog), I watched the
first half of [this MIT
lecture](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-172-performance-engineering-of-software-systems-fall-2018/lecture-videos/lecture-4-assembly-language-computer-architecture/)
on "Assembly Language & Computer Architecture" that my internet friend
recommended. The professor starts by saying programming assembly is "not as bad
as you would think" and I whole heartedly agree! It's been fun!

This lecture is definitely filling in some gaps.

Some learnings:
* In AT&T syntax the operand is second, in Intel syntax it is first.
* MOV is actually a copy. (I was wondering about this and was planning to test
  eventually).
* MOVC - a conditional move. This seems useful. I haven't come across this
  instruction yet.
* When an integer is moved from a 32 bit register to a 64 bit register the extra
  bits are always zero extended. However when an integer is moved from any other
  smaller register to any other larger register it is overwritten and NOT zero
  extended.
* When you do an e (equal) or ne (not equal) condition, it checks the ZF (zero
  flag). This is because hardware typically compares two ints by doing
  subtraction. So if the result is 0 then it is equal and if it is not zero then
  they are not equal! 💥 🤯 🤩 Woah.

### ☀️ Long Weekend Time

On day one of looking into assembly I tried to read [A Quick Guide to Go's
Assembler](https://golang.org/doc/asm) and it went so over my head. Today as I
was skimming it I realized that I understand most of it now! Maybe not
completely, but I have the building blocks to at least put things into context.
I should re-read it from start to end. But that's for another day.

Have a good weekend everyone!
