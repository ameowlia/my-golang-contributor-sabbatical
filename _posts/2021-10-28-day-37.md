### ðŸ—º Wrangling Roadmaps

I spent all of today not on golang stuff, but on doing my job as Tech Lead of
the App Runtime Platform working group for the Cloud Foundry Foundation.

Main(e)ly I spent it trying to determine how to (1) represent our roadmap and (2)
how to track all of the issues and PRs we get across 70 repos. Then I wrote all
that up in a proposal and made some nice diagrams if I do say so myself. (Feel
free to judge [for
yourself](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/d6e55fa6e8ccbcbe5a076d1c5363a81a69dd9daf/toc/working-groups/app-runtime-platform/working-agreements/2021-10-29-reviewer-workflows.md).)
