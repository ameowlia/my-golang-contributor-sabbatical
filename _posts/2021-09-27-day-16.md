### 📚 Reading Github Issues

I read over 50 new github issues this morning. Some that caught my eye:
* [A proposal to all a generic byte/string manipulation
  package](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48643). I have been doing lots of
  string <-> byte stuff recently, so this would be nice.
* [This bug about how keep alives affect cell phone
  batteries](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48622).
* [A question about TLS 1.3](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48597). Very
  familiar terrain for me.
* 🏝 [An announcement that the golang team has this week
  off](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48615). Nice!


### 🐈‍⬛  Code Reviews for Go Vet Check

In my initial proposal I had the error message "output comment block must be the
last comment block". This error message would appear for any output comment
block that was not the last comment block in the example. The reviewers thought
this would be confusing if there were multiple output blocks.

[I updated the logic](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/tools/+/351553) so that:
* when there are multiple output comments the message for all of them is: "there
  can only be one output comment block per example"
* when there is one output comment the message is: "output comment block must be
  the last comment block"


### 🧶 Opened Go Fuzz Issue

I finally opened a [github issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48657)
about making the minimized crashers for go fuzz (no hyphen) more human readable,
similar to how they are in go-fuzz (with hyphen).

I went back-and-forth on all the ways that I could add the code in a DRY way. I
didn't fully like any of them. Eventually I just picked one with the fewest
changes and I will await feedback from the maintainers.

### 🔃 More Commits Merged!

My changes to the [language
package](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/text/+/349552) was merged! Yay!
