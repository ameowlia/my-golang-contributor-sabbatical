### üìö Reading Github Issues

Only 8 new github issues this morning.
* [One was about the mobile dark
  theme](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48679). It needs help.
* [One was about the output regarding "interesting" fuzz
  inputs](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48669). Yes! A fuzzing issue that
  no one had claimed!


### üß∂ Back to Go Fuzzing

The ["interesting" inputs issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48669)
caught my eye, so I decided to set aside compiling for today. Before I claimed
it I wanted to make sure I could reproduce and fix the issue. (I wouldn't want
to have to do something embarassing like _ask for help_ or anything.)

My first question was: what _are_ "interesting" inputs???

When I was testing go fuzz for the first time on [day
8](https://ameowlia.github.io/my-golang-contributor-sabbatical/2021/09/10/day-8.html)
the example I used had 0 interesting inputs.

```
$ gotip test -fuzz=FuzzParse

found a crash, minimizing...
fuzzing, elapsed: 0.1s, execs: 27 (218/sec), workers: 4, interesting: 0
--- FAIL: FuzzParse (0.12s)
        panic: oh no! bad size!
        goroutine 11 [running]:
        runtime/debug.Stack()
        ...
```

I didn't find much information in the [draft
design](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/draft-fuzzing.md).
I grep-ed through the code and found [this
comment](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/2d6d5584179cf89e44abc2829fcdc68c29dfc5a4/src/internal/fuzz/worker.go#L512-L517). 

```
// minimizeResponse contains results from workerServer.minimize.
type minimizeResponse struct {
	// Success is true if the worker found a smaller input, stored in shared
	// memory, that was üëâ"interesting"üëà for the same reason as the original input.
	// If minimizeArgs.KeepCoverage was set, the minimized input preserved at
	// least one coverage bit and did not cause an error. Otherwise, the
	// minimized input caused some error, recorded in Err.
	Success bool
  ...
```

I tried writing an example that would create "interesting" inputs, but I kept
getting 0. My examples were very simplistic. I didn't feel like I was getting
anywhere, so I decided to replicate an old bug. I looked through [the
trophies](https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz#trophies) in the go-fuzz (with a
hyphen) repo and I chose a [bug from 2015 where invalid XML comments would cause
marshaling to fail](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/11112).

Initially I tried to reproduce this bug by going back to go1.5 when this bug was
still there and then running a fuzzing test against it. Ha, no. That did not
work. It is hard enough to run go tests using the go test source code I am
developing, let alone run a new gotip feature against an old local version of
go1.5. [The
commit](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/97c859f8da0c85c33d0f29ba5e11094d8e691e87)
fixing the bug was pretty simple, so in the end I ended up manually reverting
the fix on my local master branch of golang/go.

Turns out this example was much more "interesting" to go fuzz (no hyphen).

Here is my fuzz test:
```
func FuzzXML(f *testing.F) {
	// Seed the corpus
	f.Add([]byte("<z><!-- my - - - -comment --><b>foo</b></z>"))

	// Run the fuzz test
	f.Fuzz(func(t *testing.T, a []byte) {
		t.Parallel()
		v := new(X)
		if Unmarshal(a, v) != nil {
			t.Skip() // only test unmarshal-able things
		}
		if _, err := Marshal(v); err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}

	})
}
```

And here is the first few seconds of output:
```
$../bin/go test -fuzz=FuzzXML
fuzz: elapsed: 0s, gathering baseline coverage: 0/2 completed
fuzz: elapsed: 0s, gathering baseline coverage: 2/2 completed, now fuzzing with 4 workers
fuzz: elapsed: 3s, execs: 184966 (61597/sec), interesting: 23
fuzz: elapsed: 6s, execs: 384296 (64005/sec), interesting: 26
fuzz: elapsed: 9s, execs: 627750 (69729/sec), interesting: 30
^Cfuzz: elapsed: 10s, execs: 728539 (71595/sec), interesting: 31
PASS
ok  	encoding/xml	10.281s
```

But after I `ctl-C`ed there was no `testdata` dir! On the one hand this makes
sense because I didn't let the test run long enough to find a crasher. On the
other hand: _where_ were these "interesting" things being stored?

After digging through the code I found out that they are stored in the $GOCACHE.

```
$ ../bin/go env GOCACHE
/Users/adowns/Library/Caches/go-build
```

When I looked at the cache for this specific test it was full of files with guid
names that had inputs in them:

```
$ ls ~/Library/Caches/go-build/fuzz/encoding/xml/FuzzXML

11d583bd9e786f3b85c64107dbcf460c7908784d0103656619450d012ef041cb
16e03fe84250b0ab157cc1e6de3da3c755868a3b7dba714cc897f0417b821801
...


$ cat ~/Library/Caches/go-build/fuzz/encoding/xml/FuzzXML/*
go test fuzz v1
[]byte("oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo")
go test fuzz v1
[]byte("><")
go test fuzz v1
[]byte("\xc0\x00:⁄î.Q\u007f\xafh\xb0\xbez\xf2p\x9f\xecG\xc4\xe5A\x9en|\x10,H\x92\xff\x00\xf9")
go test fuzz v1
[]byte("<!D=\xce\x18\xa0\xec\x15\xa1--d HE")
go test fuzz v1
[]byte("\n\n\n\n\n\n\n")
go test fuzz v1
[]byte("\n")
go test fuzz v1
[]byte("\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r")
go test fuzz v1
[]byte("d")
go test fuzz v1
[]byte(">;;;;\xf8\xe8\x03\x00\x00\xb1sssss\xc2\xff\x12\xf8\xff\xb1\u008f.\xb1\xc2\xff\xf0\xf8!")
go test fuzz v1
[]byte("<!--")
go test fuzz v1
[]byte("\r")
go test fuzz v1
[]byte("[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[")
...
```

Okay! Now I can reproduce the issue!

Adding the code to fix it wasn't too much work after that. I did have a sneaky
off-by-one error that I realized from from the seed value. I [submitted my
work](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/353172) and got a code review by
Katie Hockman (!!!) back just 30 minutes later. Hopefully she likes my fixes and
it will be merged tomorrow. Another contribution in the books!
