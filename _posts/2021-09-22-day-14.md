### 📚 Reading Github Issues

After a long meeting, I read the most recent 3 pages of github issues. That
wasn't 100% of the ones that I missed, but I can only read so much.
* [There is an h2 data race that needs
  reproduction](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/484910).
* [There's one about writing up an email chain about go.mod and go.sum
  misconceptions as a blog post](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48539). Note to self: read
  that email.

### 🐈‍⬛ Adding My Check to Go Vet!

At the end of yesterday I had a failing test. Today I wrote code that got
everything passing.

It took me a long time to figure out how to (kind of) test my code out on real
codebases. I got lost in the go.mod maddness trying to get go vet to build with
my local code. I ended up copying my code over to the vendor directory in go vet
and then building and running that... and it worked! It found the buggy tests
and none of the false positives that my parser found.

I keep going over the code because I want to submit something good, but at this
point I just need to submit it. The plan is to do that first thing tomorrow. I
ran out of time today to write a proper commit message and send properly.
