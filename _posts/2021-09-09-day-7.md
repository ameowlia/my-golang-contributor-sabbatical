### üìö Reading Github Issues

Started today reading the 12 new github issues since yesterday... and there were
a handful of initially seeming promising ones!!!

* In [this one](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48277 ) someone wanted an
  example written about json offsets, which I jumped on. I wrote an example for it, but a
  contributor asked me not to submit until something else is resolved.
* [This one](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48275) was an interesting tar
  bug about how it can sometimes use future timestamps. But changing it would
  break the API contract and make things less accurate, so it was closed. No bug
  fix.
* [This one](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48274) is asking for updated
  docs about generics, one of the things I hope to learn more about since there
  is so much going on with them in the issues.
* [This one](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48270) about about CSV
  decoding. It didn't have reproduction steps. I tried, but wasn't able to
  reproduce it.
* [This one](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48268) which was asking for
  updates to the net docs! I was excited to jump on it, but then someone linked
  to a broader proposal about removing what they wanted documented. So it is
  already in flight.

I feel like I am Hermione just trying desperately to be useful, lurking in the
issues, trying to contribute _something_, _anything_.

### Back to Fuzzing

So my plan has been to dig more into fuzzing since it is a beta feature that is
getting a lot of issues. However, there are very few examples that I could find
about using it.

So I decided to take a step back and see if I could use
[go-fuzz](https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz), the external tool that developers
can currently use.

üé• I started by watching [GothamGo 2015: Fuzzing Beyond Security: Automated
Testing with go-fuzz by Filippo
Valsorda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOZbFSM7PuI&ab_channel=NationConferences).

Here is my fuzzing test for my terrible parser:
```
// +build gofuzz

package parser

func Parse(data string) {
	if len(data) == 5 {
		panic("oh no! bad size!")
	}
}

func Fuzz(data []byte) int {
	Parse(string(data))
	return 1
}
```
Then I made a corpus and added an example:
```
mkdir corpus
echo "meow" > corpus/example
```


Then I ran...
```
// build a zip file
go-fuzz-build .

// start fuzzing
time go-fuzz -bin parser-fuzz.zip -workdir=.
```

This results in an output like this, that I eventually had to kill
```

```

Running this made two more directories, `crashers` and `supressions`.

`crashers` contains information about what input caused a crash. Note that there
is only _one_ value in crashers, even though any string of length 5 would have
caused my parser to panic.

```
$ ls crashers/
6934105ad50010b814c933314b1da6841431bc8b
6934105ad50010b814c933314b1da6841431bc8b.output

$ cat crashers/66934105ad50010b814c933314b1da6841431bc8b9
00000

$ cat crashers/66934105ad50010b814c933314b1da6841431bc8b9.output
panic: oh no! bad size!

$ cat crashers/66934105ad50010b814c933314b1da6841431bc8b9.quoted
"00000"
```

Only one crasher was recorded, because only one _type_ of crash was found. This
is recorded in the suppressions dir.
```
ls suppressions/
6934105ad50010b814c933314b1da6841431bc8b

cat suppressions/6934105ad50010b814c933314b1da6841431bc8b
panic: oh no! bad size!
fuzz/go-fuz.Parse
fuzz/go-fuz.Fuzz
go-fuzz-dep.Main
main.main
```
Go-fuzz will only record one crasher for each type of panic. There is only one
panic in my bad parser (and hopefully no hidden ones) so we will only ever get one
crasher and one suppression.

Did you notice that the crasher that is recorded was "00000"? That's because the
minimizer makes the crasher as simple as possible.

I wanted to try this again, and updated my parser. Now it will only panic if it
is length 5 AND has a "z" in it. I also deleted everything from the supressions
and crashers dirs.
```
// +build gofuzz

package parser

import "strings"

func Parse(data string) {
	if len(data) == 5 {
		if strings.Contains(data, "z") {
			panic("oh no! bad size!")
		}
	}
}

func Fuzz(data []byte) int {
	Parse(string(data))
	return 1 // return 1 means that is passed the check
}
```

Again there is only one crasher. But this time it has a z! Again it is minimized
to be as simple as possible.
```
$ cat crashers/*quoted
"0z000"
```

üîç I tried to find some good functions that I could fuzz test in the code bases
I maintain, but I couldn't find any that I found appropriate. Maybe it's one of
those things that if I _knew_ about fuzzing then maybe I would write code so
that it was easy to test with it. Also maybe our functions are way to big üò≠

Now that I got the hang of go-fuzz, I hope to try out the same examples with the
built in fuzzing with the gotip tomorrow.
