### ðŸ©º Making My Own Diagnostic

I improved my diagnostic! Now it replaces things and looks pretty!

Here is my code
```
var Analyzer = &analysis.Analyzer{
	Name:     "simplifyamelia",
	Doc:      Doc,
	Requires: []*analysis.Analyzer{inspect.Analyzer},
	Run:      run,
}

func run(pass *analysis.Pass) (interface{}, error) {
	inspect := pass.ResultOf[inspect.Analyzer].(*inspector.Inspector)
	nodeFilter := []ast.Node{(*ast.BasicLit)(nil)}
	diagnostics := []analysis.Diagnostic{}
	inspect.Preorder(nodeFilter, func(n ast.Node) {
		cmt := n.(*ast.BasicLit)
		if cmt.Kind == token.STRING && strings.Contains(cmt.Value, "amelia") {
			newText := strings.ReplaceAll(cmt.Value, "amelia", "ameowlia")
			d := createDiagnostic(pass, cmt.Pos(), cmt.End(), newText)
      pass.Report(d)
		}
	})
	return nil, nil
}

func createDiagnostic(pass *analysis.Pass, start, end token.Pos, newText string) analysis.Diagnostic {
	return analysis.Diagnostic{
		Pos:     start,
		End:     end,
		Message: "Fix 'amelia'",
		SuggestedFixes: []analysis.SuggestedFix{{
			Message: "Change 'amelia' to 'ameowlia'",
			TextEdits: []analysis.TextEdit{{
				Pos:     start,
				End:     end,
				NewText: []byte(newText),
			}},
		}},
	}
}

```

My next goal is to make a diagnostic that combines all of these fixes. (I'm
inching closer to the actual issue I want to solve.)

I thought it would be as simple as adding a mega diagnostic that combines all of
the text edits from the other diagnostics. This _did_ work...but it's not
exactly what I want. That ended up showing up all the time, and it was awkward.

Currently when I highlight text a new option comes up that says "extract
function". I want something like that where it only appears when you highlight
over text.

I started looking at how "extract function" worked, but didn't get too far
before other work things call me away.
