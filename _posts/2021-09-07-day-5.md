### 📚 Reading Github Issues

Started today by reading the 52 new github issues that were still open since I
read issues last Thursday. (Actually I started the day by doing an hour of
expense reports that ended up being totally wrong. But that is less fun to write
about.)

**Trends I noticed from the issues:**
* People _really_ care about compiling:
  [1](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48192),
  [2](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48213). I continue to be shocked by
  how many people know how their code is compiled and actually have opinions on
  it.
* Lots of issues about generics: [1](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48196),
  [2](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48185). This is a [new
  proposal](https://go.dev/blog/generics-proposal) that is currently being
  worked on. I haven't dug deeply into this yet, but I expect I will sooner
  rather than later given the number of issues I am reading about it.
* Some clean up work: [1](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48154). I like
  seeing that technical debt is continuously being taken care of. I wish I
  snagged this issue though. I should've offered to work on it first. Darn.

👀 The one that caught my eye for today though, was [this
one](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48170) about improving go
vet to catch common memory leaks with `time.Tick` and `time.NewTicker`.

Then my thought process went like this:
* does gorouter (or any CF code) have this memory leak?
  * it has a similar looking one
    [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter/blob/6d52d4a6bd90296263ade679ed3f43ae83b28e31/common/component.go#L45-L53)
    * how can I ***prove*** (or disprove) if that code is leaking memory?
       * I should learn more about profiling in go!

### 📈 Profiling

🎥 I started by watching ["GopherCon 2019: Dave Cheney - Two Go Programs, Three
Different Profiling
Techniques"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nok0aYiGiYA&ab_channel=GopherAcademy).
Dave (a former fellow VMeer!) also has it expanded as a [blog
post](https://dave.cheney.net/high-performance-go-workshop/dotgo-paris.html).

I followed the examples he did in his talk and used [his profiling
package](https://github.com/pkg/profile).

Basically all it took was adding the following line to the beginning of my code:
```
defer profile.Start(profile.CPUProfile, profile.ProfilePath(".")).Stop()
// or
defer profile.Start(profile.MemProfile, profile.ProfilePath(".")).Stop()
// or
defer profile.Start(profile.TraceProfile, profile.ProfilePath(".")).Stop()
```

Then, after the program ran, I would run:
```
go tool pprof -http=:8080 cpu.pprof
// or
go tool pprof -http=:8080 mem.pprof
// or
go tool trace trace.out
```

**Things I learned about profiling:**
* pprof can show you the source code where the memory allocation/cpu usage is
  happening.
* different types of profiling have different overheads.
* the memory profiling (and others??) just take samples. By default mine sampled
  1 out of every 4096 allocations. But using the profiling package I was able to
  tune it and make it profile every allocation.
* the go tool trace uses chromes built in javascript debugger.

#### 🧠 profiling on my own in order to test my newfound profiling skills
I decided to turn to my beloved [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). I
use Project Euler problems to practice when I am trying to learn a new
language. One of the things I like about the problems is that the naïve solution
will take minutes or hours or days or years.

I settled on [problem 14: Longest Collatz
Sequence](https://projecteuler.net/problem=14). I did the naïve solution with no
goroutines, which takes nearly 7 minutes to run. By looking at the trace
profiling it was _very_ evident that only using 1 CPU was a huge bottleneck. (I
mean, obviously, but it's fun to use the tools).

I started adding goroutines for EVERY number, which then resulted in CPU starved
goroutines.

Tomorrow I plan to make some more optimizations and continue profiling. Then
I'll go back to where I started and use my new profiling knowledge to exaserbate
and monitor the `time.Tick` issue.

### ✨ Meta Thoughts
I'm 1/13 weeks down in this sabbatical. I feel a little floudering. Am I
actually contributing to golang yet? No, except some examples on day 1. Am I learning a
lot about go though? 🤷‍♀️ Yes, and that's good enough for me for now.
