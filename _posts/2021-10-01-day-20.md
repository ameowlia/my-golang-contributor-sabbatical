### ✨ Most Proud Moment
I found [a bug](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48362) where testable
examples were providing false positives. I wrote a parser and found 7 examples
of this bug in the top 1000 golang repos on github. I submitted a go vet check
to prevent this from happening again, which is now merged in!

### 🤓 How Has it Been Going?
I'm loving it! I feel like I have learned more about Go this month than I
have in the past year. It's been great to have the time to learn and poke around
with no deadlines. I wasn't sure if I would be able to take 3 months of
self-directed learning, but now I'm thinking that 3 months isn't enough! I
haven't done much with networking stuff, which was my original plan, but I've
been learning SO MUCH that it doesn't bother me. Nothing I'm learning feels
extranious, it all feels like stuff that will make me a better programmer.

### ☀️  What My Day Looks Like
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/xh4Q71t/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-11-34-09-AM.png" alt="a screenshot of my calendar">

* First I check in on CFF slack. I am the technical and execution lead for
  the App Runtime Platform Working Group (ARPWG - pronounced  "arp wiggle" in my
  mind) and I want to make sure to respond to community members.
* Next I read all the go github issues that have been opened since the day
  before. I write down any that catch my eye.
* Then I spend the rest of my time investigating one of those issues or
  researching something I am interested in.
* I _always_ try to make it to crossword time.
* I end each day by writing this blog. It has been a great resource for myself,
  especially for the little things like remembering which commands I ran last
  week to get something working.
* I only have 2 bi-weekly meetings: one with my manager (hi Chris!) and one with my
  mentor (hi Gareth!). I have ignored basically everything else, which has been great for
  focusing.

### ⚽️ Goals for the Next Two Months
I'm really happy with how things have been going. So my only goal is
"keep going".

### 💁‍♀️ Best Little Learnings
* vim: `"+y` will yank things from vim to my normal paste buffer
* vim: `ctl-v` will let you use the vertical cursor
* go: `%#v` is the best way to print any struct
  ```
  type T struct {
    a int
    b float64
    c string
}
t := &T{ 7, -2.35, "abc\tdef" }
fmt.Printf("%v\n", t)
fmt.Printf("%#v\n", t)
  ```
  This prints:
  ```
&{7 -2.35 abc   def}
&main.T{a:7, b:-2.35, c:"abc\tdef"}
  ```
