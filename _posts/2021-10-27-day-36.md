üêç Mood: Having extremely unstable wifi and using a ridiculously long ethernet
cable across my entire house aka a giant trip cord.

### üîå Wifi Woes

Initially my wifi would work for 5 minutes before needing to be restarted. Only
my work computer was having issues. Then it needed to be restarted every 3
minutes. Then 30 seconds. Restarting my computer multiple times did not fix it.
Restarting the router did not fix it. Nothing fixed it. Eventually I got the
reeeeeeeeeeeally long ethernet cable out.

### ü©∫ Gopls Tests
It turns out my mega code actions feature breaks some existing tests. I starred
at them for awhile and I was going to dig deeper into it, but then I got
distracted by a github issue.

### üá´üá∑üá¨üáß   Language Matching

Someone opened [an issue where go is matching the wrong
language](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/49176). This piqued my interest
because back on [day
10](https://ameowlia.github.io/my-golang-contributor-sabbatical/2021/09/14/day-10.html)
I had done a little digging into language matching.

I had fun digging into this bug and this is what I found out so far. I also
added the following to the issue as a comment.

**Some background Context**
1. [Match calls `getBest` ](https://github.com/golang/text/blob/master/language/match.go#L83).
1. `getBest` loops through all of the provided tags. It keeps track of a `best` option. It calls [`best.update`](https://github.com/golang/text/blob/master/language/match.go#L504) for each provided tag. If the tag is a better match than the current best, then it updates `best`.

**For the working as expected case with `desired, _, err := language.ParseAcceptLanguage("en-GB;q=1.0, fr-DE;q=0.9, fr-CA;q=0.8")`**
1. Because English is only in the list of tags once, [pin for `en-GB` is true](https://github.com/golang/text/blob/5bd84dd9b33bd2bdebd8a6a6477920a8e492d47f/language/match.go#L494-L500).
2.  This sets `m.LanguagePin` to true [here](https://github.com/golang/text/blob/5bd84dd9b33bd2bdebd8a6a6477920a8e492d47f/language/match.go#L573).
3. `en-GB` is initially made the best option because it is first and `beaten` is set to true [here](https://github.com/golang/text/blob/5bd84dd9b33bd2bdebd8a6a6477920a8e492d47f/language/match.go#L600).
4. Then the loop continues and  [`best.update`](https://github.com/golang/text/blob/5bd84dd9b33bd2bdebd8a6a6477920a8e492d47f/language/match.go#L504) is called for the next tags one at a time.
5. Because `m.LanguagePin` is true, every tag after `en-GB` returns from `update` [here](https://github.com/golang/text/blob/5bd84dd9b33bd2bdebd8a6a6477920a8e492d47f/language/match.go#L560-L562) and does _not_ replace `en-GB` as `best`. 
6.  Thus `en-GB` is returned as the best match.

**For the buggy case with `desired, _, err := language.ParseAcceptLanguage("en-GB;q=1.0, fr;q=0.9, fr-CA;q=0.8, en-DE;q=0.7")`**
1. Because English is only in the list of tags twice, [pin for `en-GB` is _false_](https://github.com/golang/text/blob/5bd84dd9b33bd2bdebd8a6a6477920a8e492d47f/language/match.go#L494-L500).
2.  This sets `m.LanguagePin` to false [here](https://github.com/golang/text/blob/5bd84dd9b33bd2bdebd8a6a6477920a8e492d47f/language/match.go#L573).
3. `en-GB` is initially made the best option because it is first and `beaten` is set to true [here](https://github.com/golang/text/blob/5bd84dd9b33bd2bdebd8a6a6477920a8e492d47f/language/match.go#L600).
4. Then the loop continues and  [`best.update`](https://github.com/golang/text/blob/5bd84dd9b33bd2bdebd8a6a6477920a8e492d47f/language/match.go#L504) is called for the next tag `fr-DE`.
5. Since `m.LanguagePin` is false, it does NOT return from `update` [here](https://github.com/golang/text/blob/5bd84dd9b33bd2bdebd8a6a6477920a8e492d47f/language/match.go#L560-L562) like in the example above.
6. This tag makes it into a tie breaker with `en-GB`. `fr-DE` ends up winning the tie-breaker [here](https://github.com/golang/text/blob/5bd84dd9b33bd2bdebd8a6a6477920a8e492d47f/language/match.go#L627).
7.  Thus `fr-DE` is returned as the best match.


‚ùì My main open question is: Where do the weights come into play? And why didn't the weights prevent
French from beating English?
