ü´ê  Mood: So hot that my berries bushes are producing fruit in October.

üéµ Soundtrack: [No Lyrics - Folk](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5ZQvfXRFbTbxJco75ve3NV). Yup, still.

### CFF is Changing

The Cloud Foundry Foundation (CFF) is changing its model: it is forming working
groups. My working group is now officially created and now I have to start
_actually_ doing the Tech Lead things.

### ü•æ Bootstrapping a Working Group

* I counted the number of repos I am responsible for: 70.
* Added github topics to all of those repos that I have write access to.
* Made a slack channel.
* Invited all of the approvers.
* Scheduled the first four working group forums (this required a lot of timezone
  math to alternate between times that are good for different regions).
* Proposed some initial working group agreements about how PRs and reviews will
  work.
* Made a github project with a _very_ rough roadmap.

### üì∫ Tomorrow: Back to Your Regularly Scheduled Programming
I should be back to the golang stuff tomorrow. I'm impressed that it took 25
working days until I had to be bothered to do some real work stuff.
