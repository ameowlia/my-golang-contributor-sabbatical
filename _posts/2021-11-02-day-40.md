### üìö Reading Github Issues

After hours of meetings in the morning, I read through the new github issues.
[This one](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/49298) about the net/netip
package caught my eye. Why? Because it is a brand new net package for go 1.18!

### ‚öôÔ∏è  ipnet

Here is the [issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/46518) Brad Fitz wrote
proposing it. Here is his [blog
post](https://tailscale.com/blog/netaddr-new-ip-type-for-go/) on why he thinks
go needs a better IP package.

Main points on why `netip` is better than `net.IP` and `net.IPAddr`:
* `net.IP` is not comparable
* `net.IP` allocates
*	`net.IP` does not track if the original IP was ipv4 or ipv6.

Allllll the way back on [day
1](https://ameowlia.github.io/my-golang-contributor-sabbatical/2021/08/30/day-1.html)
I made my first contribution: adding examples for the ip functions. Today I went to
see if this new ipnet package had any examples... nope! None!

As always, my favorite way to learn deeply about a new package is to try it out
for myself by writing examples for all of the functions. So that's what I did.
Netip has a lot of similar functions as the previous packages (I assume it will
eventually replace `net.IP` and `net.IPAddr`), but it also has a lot more nice
helper functions like: `Compare`, `Less`, `Next`, and `Prev`.

There are _lots_ of little functions, so I didn't finish writing all of the
examples today, but I plan to tomorrow.

When I was working on this, I spun up a local go pkgsite server so that I could
look at the docs via a browser and not my terminal. But I could not for the life
of me figure out how to make my local go pkgsite point to my local version of go
(rather than pulling down the latest version), despite the fact that there is a
flag for it! That I set! I eventually was able to hard code it to pull the
`master` branch rather than the latest release, but that only shows the latest
committed `netip` stuff, it does not show me my local changes. Note to self: ask
on gopher slack about this tomorrow!
