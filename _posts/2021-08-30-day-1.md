### ⚽ Goals
I started today with two goals:
* Learn more about the net package by adding examples
* Submit my first contribution

✨ And I completed both!!!


### 🔎 Finding where to contribute
Some functions in golang docs have examples. These examples are written as tests
in the actual code. I figure writing examples will (1) be a good first contribution
to make sure I understand the non-github workflow and make sure I signed the CLA
properly and (2) be a good way to learn more about the net package.

I looked through the [net package docs](https://pkg.go.dev/net) and saw that the
[IP section](https://pkg.go.dev/net#IP) was lacking a lot of examples. So I
started there!
 
### ⚙️ IP Functions
I ended up writing examples for the following 14 functions:
* Equal
* IsGlobalUnicast
* IsInterfaceLocalMulticast
* IsLinkLocalMulticast
* IsLinkLocalUnicast
* IsLoopback
* IsMulticast
* IsPrivate
* IsUnspecified
* MarshalText
* String
* To16
* To4
* UnmarshalText

I spent a lot of time trying to make the examples look as clean as possible.

### 👩‍💻 IP Learnings
While writing these examples I had to do some googling. Like "what is a global
unicast IP?" and "What is a link local multicast IP?". I watched these two
videos ["IPv6 Global Unicast Address by Rick
Graziani"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASdAFd7MkIU&ab_channel=RickGraziani)
and ["IPv6 Basics for Beginners by
danscourses"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7Al3P8ShM8&ab_channel=danscourses).
I ended up learning a lot about IPv6.

Before today I thought ipv6 was basically the same as ipv4, but just with more
addresses. Nope!

Here are some differences I learned about:
* There are no broadcast addresses in ipv6.
* Ipv6 has anycast addresses.
* There are no subnet masks in ipv6. Instead there are network prefixes.
* Ipv6 does not use address resolution protocol (ARP). Instead it uses neighbor
  discovery protocol (NDP).

### 📩 Using Gerrit
After I added the IP examples, I was ready to submit them. But golang does not
use github PRs. Instead they use Gerrit following [these
steps](https://golang.org/doc/contribute).  Instead of using `git commit` you
use `git codereview change`. This is (supposed to) add a unique Change-Id to the
commit. It wasn't working for me. It turns out that my other CF-relelated git
hooks were interfering with the codereview hook.  I removed the other hooks from
the repo and everything worked. Then I submitted my change with `git codereview
mail`. You can view my change [here](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/346289).

The go bot sent a welcome message 😊
> Congratulations on opening your first change. Thank you for your contribution!

I also learned that the golang project is in code freeze from may-july and
nov-jan. I am glad I picked aug-nov for my sabbatical! At least I'll get 2
months not during a freeze.
