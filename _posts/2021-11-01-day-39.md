### ðŸ“š Reading Github Issues
Lots of issues about the compiler and generics, including
[one](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/49241) where Filippo Valsorda(!!!) says it
was his first time writing generic code! Good to know I'm not the only one who
hasn't tried it yet.

### ðŸ§º Collating

After last week's investigation into language sorting, I decided to see if there
were any other open issues related to x/text/language. [This
one](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48061) about "incorrect sorting of
Slovak words" caught my eye. The issue is about how the `collate` function does
not sort Slovak words correctly (specifically the letters with accents). My
first thought was: wow that must suck. Imagine you are a frontend developer and
you just want to list whatever (songs, states, names, anything) in alphabetical
order. But, oh no! Go sorts them wrong! Even when you specify which language you
are using.

I started poking around the [collate
pkg](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/text@v0.3.3/collate). I was trying to
understand what was going on, but there were no examples! Something I can fix! So I
spent most of my day learning about collate by writing examples for all of the
functions.

Like this one:
```
func ExampleNew() {
	letters := []string{"Ã¤", "Ã¥", "Ã¶", "o", "a"}

	ec := collate.New(language.English)
	ec.SortStrings(letters)
	fmt.Printf("English Sorting: %q\n", letters)

	sc := collate.New(language.Swedish)
	sc.SortStrings(letters)
	fmt.Printf("Swedish Sorting: %q\n", letters)

	numbers := []string{"0", "11", "01", "2", "3", "23"}

	ec.SortStrings(numbers)
	fmt.Printf("Alphabetic Sorting: %q\n", numbers)

	nc := collate.New(language.English, collate.Numeric)
	nc.SortStrings(numbers)
	fmt.Printf("Numeric Sorting: %q\n", numbers)

	// Output:
	// English Sorting: ["a" "Ã¥" "Ã¤" "o" "Ã¶"]
	// Swedish Sorting: ["a" "o" "Ã¥" "Ã¤" "Ã¶"]
	// Alphabetic Sorting: ["0" "01" "11" "2" "23" "3"]
	// Numeric Sorting: ["0" "01" "2" "3" "11" "23"]
}
```

I ran a local copy of the go pkgsite to make sure that they showed up correctly,
and I ended up submitting a [little
PR](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/pkgsite/+/360479) there as well.


### â™º Generics

ðŸŽ¥ At the end of my day I watched my first talk about generics ["GopherCon 2020:
Robert Griesemer - Typing [Generic]
Go"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TborQFPY2IM&ab_channel=GopherAcademy). I
haven't gotten a chance to play around with generics myself yet, but hopefully
soon!
