### 📚 Reading Github Issues
Read 13 new github issues this morning.
* [One was about using an analyzer to detect code that uses
  generics](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48790)
* [One was about something in go
  fuzz](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48787), but most importantly the
  output in the issue _**uses the code that I contributed**_ 🎉🎉🎉 !

### 💬 Gopher Slack

I am in gopher slack, but I find it very overwhelming. They explicitly _don't_
use threads, which makes things very hard to follow. And some of the channels
(like #networking) are _very_ chatty. And people reply so quickly! It seems
either that (1) people respond instantly to questions so I have no time to
research answers if I wanted to help others or (2) unanswered questions are
pushed up by all the other chatting and it is so hard to follow that it is
difficult to tell if they were answered eventually or not. All this to say, I am
not very active in gopher slack.

BUT! I was in the #fuzzing channel, which is _much_ less chatty given that it is
about a beta feature, and I was able to answer someone's question! I was able to
answer said question because it came up in an issue I read a few weeks ago! This
is one of the reasons that I read all the issues! My evil plan is working!

### ✂️  Dividing in Assembly

Rather than continuing to bash my head trying to figure out how to get my
division function to work in assembly, I asked in gopher slack. And a very nice someone
helped! Apparently I needed to clear the DX register.

Here is the working function:
```
// func div(x, y int) int
TEXT ·div(SB),$0-24
	MOVQ x+0(FP), AX
	MOVQ y+8(FP), BX
	XORQ DX, DX      // <--- This is what I was missing
	IDIVQ BX
	MOVQ AX, ret+16(FP)
	RET
```

I have two open questions:
* ❓ Why did I need to clear the DX register? DX is the register where the
remainder is stored. Why couldn't IDIVQ just write over what is already in DX?
* ❓ Why did _not_ clearing the register result in an error `panic: runtime error:
integer divide by zero`? Neither the divisor or dividend were zero so why did I
get _this_ particular error?

### 🦘 Jumps in Assembly

Now that I got dividing figured out, I wanted to branch out into if statements. I
was able to write a few _very useful_ functions.


💻 **lessThanTen** returns 1 if the number is less than 10 and 2 if it is greater than 10.
```
TEXT ·lessThanTen(SB),$0
	MOVQ a+0(FP), BX
	MOVQ $10, AX
	CMPQ BX, AX
	JL LESS
	JG MORE
LESS:
	MOVQ $1, AX
	JMP END
MORE:
	MOVQ $2, AX
	JMP END
END:
	MOVQ AX, ret+8(FP)
	RET

```

💻 **isOdd** returns 0 if the number is even and 1 if the number is odd.
```
TEXT ·isOdd(SB),$0
	MOVQ a+0(FP), AX
	MOVQ $2, BX
	XORQ DX, DX
	IDIVQ BX
	CMPQ DX, $0
	JE EVEN
	JG ODD
EVEN:
	MOVQ $0, AX
	JMP END
ODD:
	MOVQ $1, AX
	JMP END
END:
	MOVQ AX, ret+8(FP)
	RET
```

This works with either of the below function signatures.
```
func isOdd(val int) bool
// OR
func isOdd(val int) int
```


### 🖨  Printing in Assembly

In the examples above I had a go file with a main function that called out to my
functions defined in assembly and then the main function would call `fmt.Println`
with the result. But for my next step I wanted to have the assembly functions
call `fmt.Println`.


I started by adding the following instruction to one of my functions, just to
see if I could call it.
```
CALL fmt·Println(SB)
```

But this resulted in an error:
```
relocation target fmt.Println not defined for ABI0 (but is defined for ABIInternal)
```

Okay... I've seen these words before. I know that they are different standards
for go assembly that were made for backwards compatibility reasons.

In the [go 1.12 release notes](https://golang.org/doc/go1.12) it says:
> The compiler toolchain now uses different conventions to call Go functions and
> assembly functions. This should be invisible to users, _except for calls that
> simultaneously cross between Go and assembly and cross a package boundary_.

😅 That's exactly what I am trying to do. Make a call that both crosses between Go
and assembly and crosses a package boundary.

So I tried to make my function use ABIInternal by amending the first line to
the following:

```
TEXT ·isOdd<ABIInternal>(SB),$0
```

But _then_ I got _this_ error:
```
ABI selector only permitted when compiling runtime, reference was to "\"\".isOdd"
```

According to this error (which is implemented
[here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/6ae3afa7e784aadea23793b0527bd8880e002d2f/src/cmd/asm/internal/asm/parse.go#L859-L862))
only go runtime assembly code is allowed to use the ABIInternal standard. Well
fine.

So I moved onto hacks! I knew from the release notes that I wouldn't be able to
cross package boundaries without hitting this error. So I made my own
print function.

💻 **evenOrOdd** prints the string "even" or "odd" based on the integer provided.

Here is the assembly:
```
TEXT ·evenOrOdd(SB),$0
	MOVQ val+0(FP), AX
	MOVQ $2, BX
	XORQ DX, DX
	IDIVQ BX
	CMPQ DX, $0
	JE EVEN
	JG ODD
EVEN:
	CALL ·printEven(SB)
	JMP END
ODD:
	CALL ·printOdd(SB)
	JMP END
END:
	RET
```


Here is the go:
```
func evenOrOdd(val int)

func printEven() {
	fmt.Println("even")
}

func printOdd() {
	fmt.Println("odd")
}
```

### 🎁 Passing Arguments in Assembly

Okay so I cheated a little bit. I didn't even pass any variables to my print
statements. I haven't even gotten to using strings yet! But before I try to pass
strings, let's start with passing ints.

💻 **printVal** Prints the argument passed to it

Here is the assembly:
```
TEXT ·printVal(SB),$0
	MOVQ val+0(FP), AX
	MOVQ AX, 0(SP)      <--- Do this magic thing I found on stack overflow
	CALL ·printInt(SB)
	RET
```

Here is the go:
```
func printVal(val int)

func printInt(val int) {
	fmt.Println(val)
}
```
And it works! It prints it! But how? 🤷‍♀️ No idea. Will work on it
tomorrow along with passing multiple variables.
