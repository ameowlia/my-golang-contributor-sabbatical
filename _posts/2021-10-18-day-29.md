üò∞ Mood: Frantically refreshing the live race results every hour on the hour for
[Big's Backyard Ultra](https://my.raceresult.com/183854/#0_B3DC1F). Currently 5
people left who have run 241 miles.

### üìö Reading Github Issues

I read the 30 new issues since Thursday.
* Two were about fuzzing: [1](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48989),
  [2](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48984). Both looks do-able, but I
  already have an open PR for a go fuzz fix. I don't want to pick up more work
  until my previous work is reviewed.
* There was [one about testable
  examples](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/49036) not working properly IRL
  (but passing tests) with local files. Looked intersting, but it
  sounds like the author wants to handle it.

### üëÄ What to work on next?

I started out feeling aimless today. Last week I got frustrated with the lack
of documentation around go assembly. I did find assembly interesting and I could
look more into a different assembly language, but I feel like I am straying
further and further from the point of this sabbatical.

I wrote some testable examples for some functions in the net package
([1](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/356535),
[2](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/356536)) just to give me something
productive to do that wouldn't take much time.

Then I started looking through the issues marked ["help
wanted"](https://github.com/golang/go/labels/help%20wanted). Maybe you've wondered
why I didn't start here in the first place? Well, it turns out that most of the
issues labeled "help wanted" already have fixes submitted. I would estimate
9/10 of the issues that I think look interesting based on their title are
already complete. This is a sucky (my editor claims this is spelled 'suckey'???)
user experience, which is why I have been gravitating towards the new issues
everyday.

### ü•∫ Go, please

Eventually after sifting through pages of "help wanted" issues, I found [this
one](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/44814) from March 2021. It is about the
code formatting suggestions that you get via gopls in your code editor. The
feature is to add a "fix all" option when you highlight a section. This is one
of the (many) areas of go that I am unfamiliar with; seems like there could be
some fun digging here.

My ideal next steps are:
1. Duplicate the example in the github issue
1. Find some gopls logs
1. Figure out how to use a local version of gopls
1. Fix it

üé• Even before those steps, you know I had to watch some videos
* ["GopherCon 2019: Rebecca Stambler - Go, pls stop breaking my
  editor"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFJfdWzBHwE&ab_channel=GopherAcademy)
* ["GopherCon 2019 Lightning Talk: Paul Jolly - gopls + vim =
  govim"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiBZetR733Y&ab_channel=GopherAcademy)

I learned:
* Gopls is a language server that follows the Language Server Protocol (LSP).
* Before gopls all the editors called out to the tens of go tools to do the
  different editor-y things you and I love (goto definition, autocomplete, etc).
  This means lots of integration points and lots of breakage.
* Now every editor can speak to the gopls via a standard API.
* Now gopls can handle all of the logic of knowing if you are using modules or
  not.
* Now gopls is maintained by the go team and is thoroughly tested.

### üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Step 1: Use gopls to duplicate the issue

I use vim for 95% of my text editor needs. I even write this blog in vim. I am
_terrified_ of messing up my vim config, so I will _not_ be testing this
out with vim. I decided to try it out with sublime. I installed sublime,
immediately had problems, finally figured out that they are because I used `mv`
to move the application into the application directory instead of finder and
that somehow screws things up? Then I had tons of problems getting it to use
gopls. Okay. Scrap sublime. Let's try VSCode!

Wwith a few button clicks VSCode "just worked" with gopls.

* I duplicated the example in the github issue üëà this was step 1!
* I enabled trace logging for gopls and found the logs üëà this was step 2!
* Got a cool debug server up for gopls that has a ton more debug information
  ([reference
  guide](https://go.googlesource.com/tools/+/refs/tags/gopls/v0.3.0-pre1/gopls/doc/troubleshooting.md#:~:text=For%20VSCode%20users%2C%20the%20gopls,%2BK%20Ctrl%2BH%20))

Tomorrow I will try to get my own local version of gopls running.
