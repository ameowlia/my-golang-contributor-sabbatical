### ü¶Å More Parsing

I fixed my bash script and I finished parsing the rest of the [top 1000 golang
repos on github by
stars](https://github.com/kaxap/arl/blob/master/README-Go.md). Once removing
duplicates due to vendoring, I found 5 additional examples of the bug. I opened
issues for the ones I found. I shared this research [on the
issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48362) and got two ‚ù§Ô∏ès. Yayyyyy.

Two of these examples were hiding failing tests, including skipper, which
someone has investigated and submitted a PR for already!

I would've done PRs for the trival ones, but to do that I have to wrangle
employer stuff and that will take days. I'll check next week and see if any of
them are not done yet and then I will go through that hassle. Next step is
adding it as a go vet check!

### üêà‚Äç‚¨õ Go Vet

üé• I watched this video to learn more: ["GopherCon UK 2019: Michael Matloob - Using and Writing Go Analyses"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10IMWTpCSIQ&ab_channel=GopherConUK).

Then I started poking around
[CheckExample](https://cs.opensource.google/go/x/tools/+/refs/tags/v0.1.6:go/analysis/passes/tests/tests.go;l=111)
like one of the maintainers suggested.

I ended the day by having a failing test (yay TDD).

### üìö Reading Github Issues

Skipped it again because I was too focused on parsing!
