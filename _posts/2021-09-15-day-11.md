### ☀️  Morning (Lack of) Progress

Started today by wrangling expense reports for another hour. Wow she has a lot
of expense reports you might think. But no, these are all the same expenses
report that I keep trying to submit that keep getting rejected. Also an all hands
meeting. Needless to say, no golang work got done.

### 📚 Reading Github Issues

I started this afternoon by reading the 11 new github issues.  From [this
issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48394) I learned that go playground
lets you talk to the loopback interface to test networking packages. Cool!

### ✏️ Updating the Contributors Guide

As I mentioned last week, one thing I wish was in the contributors guide was a
way to run the tests for individual packages. You can't just run them like
normal go tests. An easy PR and win for all!

Initially I spent most of my time trying to figure out _which_ repo the website
is in. Turns out it is:
[https://github.com/golang/website](https://github.com/golang/website). It was
easy to follow the readme and run the server. When I ran it I realized.....there is
already a section on how to run individual packages tests:
[https://golang.org/doc/contribute#quick_test](https://golang.org/doc/contribute#quick_test).
I had just missed it. And to make it worse, I was doing it wrong. Well, at least
I learned something. No quick and easy contribution for me then.


### 👀 Searching for Bad Examples

Next I turned my mind back to [the issue I
filed](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48362) about false positives in
examples when there is a comment after the output comment block. Technically you
are not allowed to have comments after the output comment block, but since
everything passes when you _do_ have comments after the output comment block it
is easy to miss. I found one example of this a couple days ago. But now I am
curious if there are more. Is this worth writing a `go vet` warning for?

Time to figure out how to parse things.

🎥 I watched the following two videos on scanning and parsing in golang
* ["justforfunc #24: what's the most common identifier in the Go
  stdlib?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k23xhJoTbI4&list=PL64wiCrrxh4Jisi7OcCJIUpguV_f5jGnZ)
* ["justforfunc #25: deeper program analysis with go/parser"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRWCa84pykM&ab_channel=justforfunc%3AProgramminginGo) 

One of the most important things I learned was about the
[`go-spew package`](https://github.com/davecgh/go-spew) which is an easy way to
print (spew) ast nodes.

I was able to get a prototype working that:
* grabs all example tests in a file
* grabs all comments
* finds the comments for each test
* checks if each comment is (1) an output comment and if it is (2) the last comment
  in the test
  * if it IS an output comment and IS NOT the last comment in a test
    * then it prints a warning

⚠️  Warning: unrefactored, untested code ahead.

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"go/ast"
	"go/doc"
	"go/parser"
	"go/token"
	"log"
	"regexp"
)

var outputPrefix = `(?i)^[[:space:]]*(unordered )?output:`

type CommentForExample struct {
	Index    int
	IsOutput bool
	Text     string
}

func main() {
	fset := token.NewFileSet()
	node, err := parser.ParseFile(fset, "examples_test.go", nil, parser.ParseComments)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	examples := doc.Examples(node)

	for _, e := range examples {
		b := e.Code

		pos, end := b.Pos(), b.End()

		numberOfCommentBlocks := 0
		comments := []CommentForExample{}
		for _, cg := range e.Comments {
			if cg.Pos() < pos {
				continue
			} else if cg.End() > end {
				break
			} else {
				_, _, ok := exampleOutput(cg)
				com := CommentForExample{
					Index:    numberOfCommentBlocks,
					IsOutput: ok,
					Text:     cg.Text(),
				}
				comments = append(comments, com)
				numberOfCommentBlocks++
			}
		}
		for _, c := range comments {
			if c.IsOutput && c.Index != (numberOfCommentBlocks-1) {
				fmt.Printf("OH NO! Test: %q\nDangerous Comment: %q\n\n", e.Name, c.Text)
			}
		}
	}
}

func exampleOutput(comment *ast.CommentGroup) (output string, unordered, ok bool) {
	// test that it begins with the correct prefix
	text := comment.Text()
	matched, err := regexp.MatchString(outputPrefix, text)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	if matched {
		return text, false, true
	}
	return "", false, false // no suitable comment found

}
```

One weird this is that the type [`Example`](https://pkg.go.dev/go/doc#Example)
_has_ a value `Comments`. But this value seems to be the comments for the ENTIRE
file, not just for that example. That why I needed to do the position checking.
I heavily cribbed that part from
[`lastComment`](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/181e8cde301cd8205489e746334174fee7290c9b/src/go/doc/example.go#L437-L452),
which returns the last commentgroup for an example. Yesterday when I saw that
function I was wondering why they had to do all of the position checking and now
I understand. 🤔 I don't understand why it was built this way though.

So here is my example test file:
```
package language_test

import "fmt"

func ExampleMeow() {
	fmt.Println("meow")

	// Output:
	// meow
}

func ExampleBark() {
	fmt.Println("bark")

	// Output:
	// bark
	// bark

	// oops
}
```
And when I run my program and point it at that file, I get the following output:
```
$ go run main.go
OH NO! Test: "Bark"
Dangerous Comment: "Output:\nbark\nbark\n"
```

🎉Yay! It worked! Now I just need to figure out how to parse all of the files in
a directory. Sounds solvable, but I don't have time for it today.

👋 See you all Monday I'm off on vacation! 🏔 🚴‍♀️🌊
