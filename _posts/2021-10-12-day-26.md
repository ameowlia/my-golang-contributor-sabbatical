### ðŸ›Œ I got paged :(
I got paged just as I woke up this morning. I worked on this all day and didn't
do any fun assembly stuff.

### ðŸŽ“ But I used my golang knowledge!
I was able to use my newfound golang knowledge plus git bisect to find out
exactly which go commit broke us, look through the code, understand the root
cause, decide it was not a go bug, and move forward with helping the customer.
