### 📚 Reading Github Issues
Started this week by reading 38 new github issues.
* One was about a possible issue in Go 1.14, which is no longer supported.  The
  author wrote that "this is in production" and they can't tell the app team to
  upgrade. Which, yikes. But also, I know how much work it is to keep go
  up-to-date.
* [One was about how the garbage collector data is stored as PCDATA and FUNCDATA
  by the compiler](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48740) and possible
  optimizations. I didn't understand everything, but I understood a lot more
  than I would have a week ago. Which is the whole reason I started diving into
  the compiler, so yay!
* [Lots of issues created to track a gomote
  epic](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/47521).
* Two new go fuzz (no-hypen) issues: [one about crashes while
  minimizing](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48731) and [one about more
  documentation](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48717).


### 🧶 Go Fuzz Update

My go fuzz fix was merged today!

> internal/fuzz: print size of interesting cache
>
> This change updates the log lines to clarify that the printed
> interesting count is only for newly discovered cache entries, and prints
> the total cache size. It only prints information about interesting
> entries when coverageEnabled is true.


### 🎥 Go Contributor AMA

Given that it is Monday I didn't feel like diving straight into go assembly
again. Instead I watched [GopherCon 2020: Ask Me Anything with the Go
Team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNHwHLNLjLs&ab_channel=GopherAcademy). It
was okay. I learned some interesting tidbits though:
* Go pls does not support goland. (I assume goland does its own integrations?)
* Go pls tests their new versions against go v1.12+ since many users don't keep
  their golang up-to-date. I feel like this is the theme today.
* There are "many dozens" of people (not just eng) on the go team.
* They are looking at ways to better alert on how to know if you code is
  vulnerable to CVEs. Not just if you are using a package with a known CVE, but
  if you are actually using the code path that triggers the CVE.
* When asked for areas of improvement, one person added they "need to onboard
  people better". So it's nice to know everywhere has the same problems.
* They really avoided the question of why go doesn't have a foundation.

### 🧩 Reviewing Assembly From Before

I started by going back to the assembly I was looking at last week. I ended up
learning a few new things:

* `MOVL $2, AX` : is literally just putting the number 2 into the register AX.
  This means that the compiler (or something) already summed `1 + 1` since it was
  hardcoded and stored it as `2`. I checked this by changing the hardcoded
  values and looking at the assembly output.
* I also learned that "inlining" is not what I thought it was. Rather than try
  to explain the nonsense that I _thought_ it was, I am going to post what _it
  is_ here:

> To inline a function call is to bring the body of the function over to where
> it’s being called — thus, reducing the (small but unavoidable) overhead of a
> function call. Tweaks like this can get our code from fast to super fast.
> \- [An Introduction to the Go
> Compiler](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/the-go-compiler)

* When I turned _off_ inlining, the function only required 48 bytes (instead of
  64). My guess is that it inlined the `fmt.Println` function, which would
  explain why I did not see that function called.

💀 I think I have beat that example to death and I am ready to move onto
something new. Why not... write my own assembly?

### 🧩 Writing My Own Assembly

I started by following this [blog post](https://goroutines.com/asm) to write my
own add method is assembly.

The code looked like this...

math.go:
```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strconv"
)

func add(x, y int) int

func main() {
	argsWithoutProg := os.Args[1:]
	function := argsWithoutProg[0]
	a, err := strconv.Atoi(argsWithoutProg[1])
	if err != nil {
		panic("a")
	}
	b, err := strconv.Atoi(argsWithoutProg[2])
	if err != nil {
		panic("b")
	}

	var result int
	if function == "add" {
		result = add(a, b)
  }
	fmt.Println(result)
}
```

math.s:
```
// func add(x, y int) int

// make function add
TEXT ·add(SB),$0

  // load variable x at memory address 0(FP) (I guess we have to know it is already there) into BX
	MOVQ x+0(FP), BX

  // load var y which is at 8(FP) into register BP
	MOVQ y+8(FP), BP

  // add BP and BX. set the value in BX.
	ADDQ BP, BX

  // move BX into the return value 16FQ
	MOVQ BX, ret+16(FP)

  // return
	RET
```

And it worked! Wooo!

Next I really stretched my assembly knowledge, changed six characters, and wrote
a subtract function:
```
TEXT ·sub(SB),$0
	MOVQ x+0(FP), BX
	MOVQ y+8(FP), BP
	SUBQ BP, BX
	MOVQ BX, ret+16(FP)
	RET
```

Then I tried to make a multiply function and.... got stuck. It took me FOREVER
to figure out what the name of the instruction was for multiply and what
arguments it takes.

I ended up finding this [github
issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/29538) that was written by one of the
Go maintainers who I see often about how _he_ was learning how Go uses x86
assembly and how difficult he found it to play with. Relateable! One of the
things he mentioned in the issue is that when he got stuck he would write the
function in Go, look at the assembly that the compiler spits out, and then use
that as inspiration.

So I wrote a multiply method in Go, compiled it, and looked at the assembly, and
was able to determine that the instruction was looking for was `IMULQ` and I
wrote this beautiful function:

```
TEXT ·mult(SB),$0
	MOVQ x+0(FP), BX
	MOVQ y+8(FP), BP
	IMULQ BX, BP
	MOVQ BP, ret+16(FP)
	RET
```

Next was division. Based on some googling I knew that [DIVQ is
bad](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/9246) and you shouldn't use it (you
can't stop me). So I wasn't surprised when I didn't see any `DIV`-like
instructions when I wrote a div function in Go and then looked at the assembly
for it. But when I turned off optimizations it _did_ use the instruction
`IDIVQ`, but only with one argument.


Based on my 2.5 days worth of compiler/assembly knowledge I assumed that the
instruction only had one argument because the divisor is implicit and you just
have to know to store it in some register before you call divide. But which
register? I tried a few randomly (didn't work). I tried to google (didn't work).
I searched the source code (worked! But it actually didn't.) and I found
[this](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/199ec4235000a51518802ce822447df5901c7df5/src/cmd/compile/internal/amd64/ssa.go#L302-L306):

```
	case ssa.OpAMD64DIVQ, ssa.OpAMD64DIVL, ssa.OpAMD64DIVW:
		// Arg[0] (the dividend) is in AX.
		// Arg[1] (the divisor) can be in any other register.
		// Result[0] (the quotient) is in AX.
		// Result[1] (the remainder) is in DX.
```

Great, the secret registrar is AX! So I tried...

```
TEXT ·div(SB),$0
	MOVQ x+0(FP), AX
	MOVQ y+8(FP), BP
	IDIVQ BP
	MOVQ AX, ret+16(FP)
	RET
```

But... nope. It fails:
```
$ go build . && ./math div 4 2
panic: runtime error: integer divide by zero
[signal SIGFPE: floating-point exception code=0x7 addr=0x108b56d pc=0x108b56d]

goroutine 1 [running]:
main.div(0x4, 0x2)
	/Users/adowns/workspace/amelia/assembly-day-21/math_amd64.s:30 +0xd
main.main()
	/Users/adowns/workspace/amelia/assembly-day-21/math.go:31 +0x19a
```

I printed out the registrars to make sure they were set correctly (they were).
But I'm not really sure what went wrong. My ideas for tomorrow are: (1) do a
brute force attempt with setting all the registers and see which ones are being
used and if that doesn't work, (2) think harder about the sizes of things and
see if I am doing byte math wrong somewhere, (3) move onto loops and figure out how to do
division without using `IDIVQ`.
