### 📚 Reading Github Issues

I started my day by reading the 25 new github issues that had been created since
yesterday. Two topics caught my eye:

1. [The first was about Go's test coverage
   implemtnation](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48147). The occurs when
   there is code after a panic. It is obvious when looking at a sample that this
   code will never be run. However, Go will consider this code "covered".
   Apparently this is a known issue in Go's coverage implementation. (This is
   where I wish I had the jots emoji outside of slack.)

1. The second set of interesting issues were about fuzz:
   [1](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48132),
   [2](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48131),
   [3](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48130),
   [4](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48129),
   [5](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48128),
   [6](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48127). This led to the question:
   what is fuzzing?


### 🧶 Fuzzing

> Fuzzing or fuzz testing is an automated software testing technique that
> involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer
> program. The program is then monitored for exceptions such as crashes, failing
> built-in code assertions, or potential memory leaks.
> \- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing)

There are 3rd party developer tools like
[go-fuzz](https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz) that do this, but now it is being
added to Go itself.

📚 I read more about fuzzing in Go here:
* [Fuzzing is Beta Ready](https://go.dev/blog/fuzz-beta)
* [Design Draft: First Class
  Fuzzing](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/draft-fuzzing.md)
* [github issue: "testing: add fuzz test
  support"](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/44551)

I was able to get an example based on the one from the "Fuzzing is Beta Ready"
blog post running. I can get it to (correctly) fail, but wasn't able to see the
value that caused it to fail. It is supposed to be in the GOCACHE somewhere, but
I couldn't find it. Also, I don't think I got the mutator engine working?

🕵️‍  I'm going to need to play around with this more. There aren't a ton of examples that
I could find online. Most googling results show examples for go-fuzz and not the
new beta features.

### ✨ Today's Highlights
* I downloaded gotip for the first time to use the fuzz beta feature
* I commented on my (possibly?) first ever [go
  issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48127) with some very in-depth
  comments.
* I always associated "big-endian" with computer memory, but in the issue linked
  above, Russ Cox wrote: _"Generally, we try to keep the flag names big-endian, so
  that related flags all have a common prefix, like bench, benchtime, benchmem;
  memprofile, memprofilerate; even fuzz, fuzzcachedir, fuzzminimizetime,
  fuzztime, fuzzworker"_. I love that use of the word big-endian! I also love
  CLI consistency 👩‍🍳.
* I had a fun time thinking about algorithms again with the [fuzz crash
  minimizer](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48129)!
