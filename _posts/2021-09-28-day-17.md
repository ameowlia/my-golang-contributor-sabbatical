### 📚 Reading Github Issues

Read at least 20 new github issues this morning nothing super exciting.

### 🐈‍⬛ My Go Vet Check Was Merged!!!

My third - and by far largest -
[contribution](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/tools/+/351553) has been
merged! Yay! There are now 6 "meows" in
[golang/tools](https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/b182fdeb5a9e86b7d7857fecea90d70768bd9672/go/analysis/passes/tests/testdata/src/a/a_test.go#L56-L94).
I couldn't be prouder.


### 🧶 Updates on My Go Fuzz Issue
This morning I found that my [go
fuzz issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48657) had been closed given
that it was a duplicate of [this
one](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48129). Oops! I did search before I
opened it. I swear!

I ended up changing my commit to point to this issue and resubmitted it. I also
added this comment to my PR:
> Hello 👋
>
> I originally open this code for this issue golang/go#48657, which ended up being
> duplicate/subset of golang/go#48129.
>
> Some open thoughts I have on this change:
> * I am not in love with how I changed the function signature for minimizeBytes.
>   Your feedback on this is welcome.
> * I wasn't sure if I should minimize symbols to "$". Maybe that is too American
>   centric? "=" is another option.
> * In issue golang/go#48129 Russ Cox suggested a different algorithm for
>   minimizing. If you would prefer that algorithm I am happy to change this.

### 🪡  The Go Compiler

As someone who has never had to think about compiling beyond remembering to set
`GOOS`, I have been shocked my the number of github issues about the compiler.
This is _really_ out of my realm. Definitely not something covered in my CS 101
class or my 9 week bootcamp. Well, this is the perfect time to learn! My goal is
to move compiling from the "it's ✨_~m@G!c~_✨" part of my brain to the "oh, I know
the broad strokes of how that works" part of my brain.

🎥 I started by watching ["GopherCon 2020: Jaana Dogan - Debugging Code
Generation in
Go"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPIB3STWXVk&list=PL2ntRZ1ySWBfUint2hCE1JRxRWChloasB&index=10&ab_channel=GopherAcademy)

(Side note: I've really enjoyed the time I've had to go through past GopherCon
conference talks during this sabbatical! A few years ago, I remember thinking
"A conference about a language?? That sounds so boring" and now I'm like
"Wow, I wish I had the time to watch every talk from GopherCon 2020 and I can't
wait until it's safe to do conferences in person again". The times have
changed.)

From Jaana's talk I learned about a lot of commands I can run to inspect my
code:
* `go build` flags
  * `-a` forces a rebuild, even if it's in the cache. This would've been nice
    when I was testing my go vet check. Because I would change comments, but
    that isn't enough to bust the cache even though my tests _were_ testing
    comments.
  * `-x` shows tooling invocations
  * `-n` dry run: shows tooling invocations, but doesn't run them
  * `-work` stops the $WORK directory from being cleaned up so you can inspect
    the temporary dir and all the temporary files made during compilation
* `go build` gc (go compiler) flags
  * `-gcflags="-S"` generates the intermediary assembly (not the platform
    specific assembly)
  * `-gcflags="-N"` disables optimizations
  * `-gcflags="-l"` disables inlining
  * `-gcflags="-l -l"` extra inlining
  * `-gcflags="-m"` see what is escaping to the heap
  * `-gcflags="-m=2"` see what is escaping to the heap with more detail
* `GOSSAFUNC=FUNCTION_NAME go build -a` makes a really cool html page that you
  can open in your browser and you can interact with all of the different
  compilation stages

Jaana's talk was good, but it assumed more knowledge about assembly and
compiliers than I currently have. So then I watched this ["x86 Assembly Crash
Course"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75gBFiFtAb8&ab_channel=HackUCF).

I can't say everything is clear, but I think the best next step is just to dive
in, run some of these commands, and try to understand them myself.

I made this little file called `sum.go`:
```
1 package main
2
3 import "fmt"
4
5 func main() {
6   sum := 1 + 1
7   fmt.Println(sum)
8 }
```

And then I looked at the assembly. This code has been edited to fit nicely and
to only contain the bits that (I think) I am interested in.
```
$ go build -gcflags="-S"

```

I started looking up each of the instructions meant and adding them in comments.
I want to go through this and understand it better, but I ran out of time today.

While doing this I came across the official go doc ["A Quick Guide to Go's
Assembler"](https://golang.org/doc/asm). Wow. It would be generous if I said
that I understood 10% of that. Just in case I started thinking I understood
_anything_ here are some choice quotes that set me straight:
* _"The assembler works on the semi-abstract form, so when you see an
  instruction like MOV what the toolchain actually generates for that operation
  might not be a move instruction at all, perhaps a clear or load. Or it might
  correspond exactly to the machine instruction with that name."_
* _"Constant expressions in the assembler are parsed using Go's operator
  precedence, not the C-like precedence of the original. Thus 3&1<<2 is 4, not
  0—it parses as (3&1)<<2 not 3&(1<<2)."_
* _"There are four predeclared symbols that refer to pseudo-registers."_

😵‍💫 So all I know is that nothing is as it seems.

Also while I was researching these instructions, I found the following interesting
resources that I want to keep in my back pocket:

  Assembly"](https://github.com/teh-cmc/go-internals/tree/master/chapter1_assembly_primer)

  Programming"](https://blog.sgmansfield.com/2017/04/a-foray-into-go-assembly-programming/)
