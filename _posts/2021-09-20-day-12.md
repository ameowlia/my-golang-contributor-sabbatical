### ☀️  Morning Issue Updates

I opened my email this morning to see that I forgot to re-run the tests after I
made the suggested changes to the [language example
fix](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/text/+/349552). Huge facepalm. How
embarassing. I fixed the now changed indices and re-pushed the code. At least
the reviewer was nice about it and the automated output was really clear. The
bot automatically ran my code on a bunch of different infrastructure and had
a link to logs for each one.

### 🔍 Back to Parsing

I reread my last blog post to remember what I was doing last Wednesday. 😅
Honestly this blog is mostly just for me to remember what I have done.

I set to work improving my parser so that it could take a directory, find every
example test in it, and parse it to see if it contained [the issue I have been
tracking](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48362).

You can see the cleaned up parser code
[here](https://gist.github.com/ameowlia/f8f56b6bd63a7072382a2118f7183ff4).

🐞 I ran it against the golang/go repo... AND I FOUND ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE
BUG! I opened another [issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48494) and
made a fix! I also found a false positive. Hmmmm, I will have to dig into it
more, but it was only one or two false positives so I don't mind ignoring for
now. Easy enough to check by hand.

Then I downloaded all of the other repos under the "golang" github org and...
nothing. Which is good. But I am also slightly sad about it. Delusions of
grandeur and all that.

One of the commenters of the main issue suggested running my parser against a
"corpus of open source code". After not finding any helpful github api calls, I
took this [list of top golang github
repos](https://github.com/kaxap/arl/blob/master/README-Go.md) and cleaned it up
using some vim macros. Then I wrote a bash script that: (1) cloned the repo, (2)
ran my parser on it, (3) deleted the repo. I did all of this on a GCP VM just in
case I messed something up and ended up with too many cloned repos. It ran
through the first 115 repos without finding any issues (except an issue with my
bash script that caused it to stop working). I'm not surprised that I didn't
find any hits. I don't know of any repo that uses the example tests outside of
go itself.

### 🕵️‍♀️ Next Steps for Parsing

Tomorrow (maybe?) I'll get the bash script working to continue checking other open source
golang repos for this bug.

On the main issue I suggested that this might make a good go vet warning and a
go maintainer agreed! He even suggested a similar warning to base it off of! So
exciting! This could be a real non-documentation contribution 🙌

### 🎉 PARTY TIME
As of 10 minutes ago...[MY FIRST CONTRIBUTION WAS
MERGED!](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/350995)

🤩 On an issue I opened a go maintainer wrote ["thanks for working on
this"](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48494#issuecomment-923251276). Can
you tell that words of affirmation is my first love language?

### 📚 Reading Github Issues

I didn't do it! I'm going to have a lot of catching up tomorrow!
