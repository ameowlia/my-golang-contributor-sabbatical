üò¥ Mood: sleepy and existentially pondering the expanse of time that I have to
self direct my learning

### üìö Reading Github Issues

Before starting this sabbatical I read Andr√© Arko's blog post ["How to
Contribute to Open Source or: From No Experience to the Core Team in 15 Minutes
Per Day"](https://andre.arko.net/2016/11/12/how-to-contribute-to-open-source/).
One of Andr√©'s suggestions is to read everything, including _every single open
issue_. He suggests chipping away at this for 15 minutes a day. Despite reading
this blog post back when he published it in 2016, this point has stuck with me.

üò± **Go has over 5k open issues.** While I don't expect to get through them anytime
soon, I did start making my way through them.

I read:
* Every issue that was opened in the last 24 hours
* The most recent open issues related to the net package
* Every open issue that references "cloud foundry" ...now I am realizing that I
  forgot to search "cloudfoundry" and I realize that I missed some. I will check
  in with those tomorrow!

Here is what I found when reading those issues:
* [Some issues are fixed very
  quickly!](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48085) I thought they might seem
  like easy bugs for me to reproduce and fix, but within a couple hours of
  opening someone else had already submitted a fix.
* I found two that are about documentation that I might take a look at later:
  [1](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/34124),
  [2](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/31991). One of them is even commented
  on by @domdom82, a ~~partner in crime~~ fellow contributor in the Cloud
  Foundry Foundation.
* I found three that would require much bigger changes, but I actually
  understood (at least a little) what was going on and why the change was
  wanted: [1](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/36921),
  [2](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/36822),
  [3](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/31259).
* I found [one](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/31863) that I think we ran
  into with gorouter. We decided that golang was doing the right thing for
  generic clients/servers, but we added a fix for it in gorouter for our
  customers.


### üé• Watched: "Asynchronous Networking Patterns"

After I consumed as many github issues as possible without my eyes glazing over
I moved on to a different format for learning. Videos! I searched youtube for
videos about the net package and I found a great one from Filippo Valsorda, a
golang contributor whom Eli Wrenn and I are kinda obsessed with.

The video is ["GopherCon 2018: Filippo Valsorda- Asynchronous Networking
Patterns"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afSiVelXDTQ&ab_channel=GopherAcademy).

The talk covered:
* A dive into the net package by making a simple server and proxy by using only
  the primatives.
* How goroutines differ from event loops
* At one point Filippo said something like "you don't want to fatal here,
  because that would destroy all of the other connections". Yup, this is a bug I
  fixed once.
* Talked about SNI, which is something a team recently PRed into our TCP Router
  system.
* Multireaders üò≤

### ‚úèÔ∏è  Writing More Examples!

I started writting more examples for more code in the net package. Today I did
IpAddr and TCPAddr. I didn't submit today because I want to add more for
UDPAddr, UnixAddr, and HardwareAddr at the same time. These examples have been a
fun way to explore parts of the net package that I haven't seen before.

### üêà Miscellaneous Learnings
* vim: `"+y` will yank things from vim to my normal paste buffer
* vim: `gq` will wrap highlighted lines. Perfect for writing blog posts like
  this one.
* go: `%q` in a `fmt.Printf` will print the string with quotes around it
* I love clear communication and I saw these linked in the gopher slack
