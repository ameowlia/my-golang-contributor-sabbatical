### üéÅ Wrapping Up Languages

I'm trying to wrap up everything in progress.

A go contributor got back to me about the Slovak sorting with a question about
whether the bug was in the go code or in the unicode spec. This sent me down a
rabbit hole of combing through the spec again for a couple hours. I still think
that the bug is in go. I wrote up that investigation and [added it to the
issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48061).

I went to wrap up the artificial language investigation. As I was writing
out my [explanation of the bug](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/45749), I
got excited about fixing it and said I would submit a fix. I love over
committing myself.

### üîÆ What's Next

I only have 2 more working days until the end of my sabbatical. Where did the
time go?

My goals for the next two days are:
* Submit a fix for the artificial language investigation
* Write a blog post wrap up of my time in this experiment
* Write a presentation to give to my company about how my sabbatical went
