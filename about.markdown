👋 **Hi, I'm Amelia.** I'm a staff software engineer at VMware where I work on
networking things in Golang. I recently had a three month sabbatical approved
where I will contribute to Golang full-time.

👩‍💻 **I like networking things.** I've used Golang professionally for
over 5 years and currently maintain an HTTP reverse-proxy and a CNI plugin
among other networking things for Tanzu Application Service (TAS née PAS née
ERT). Additionally I am the Networking Project Lead that oversees those
projects for the open source Cloud Foundry Foundation.

✏️  **This blog will be a record of my sabbatical.** I plan on using this blog
as a way to keep notes for myself to keep me motivated and organized. If
someone else finds it helpful too, that is just an added bonus.

✨ **I love using emojis** to make written communication clearer, backpacking
long distances, and pink.

🐻 You can find me in the Gophers slack as @ameowlia.
